## Introduction

This article is about the installation of the TS3Audiobot, which is completely set up and ready for use within 5 minutes.

**Prerequisites**

The prerequisite for this installation is to have a cloud server that runs on **Ubuntu 20.04** or newer.

I recommend the Hetzner cloud server **CX21**, which offers sufficient performance, the **location** of the server is up to you. In the tutorial, we will use **Falkenstein** as location.

## Step 1 - Update & Upgrade

The very first thing we do is update the package lists and packages on the server so that we are up to date.

```shell
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

## Step 2 - Install Dependencies

Now we install the necessary dependencies for the ts3audiobot, including Git, Libopus & YoutubeDL

```shell
apt -y install git libopus-dev ffmpeg youtube-dl apt-transport-https wget sudo
```

### Step 2.1 - Load & install repositories from dotnet

```shell
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/20.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
```

```shell
apt update -y && apt install dotnet-sdk-3.1 -y
```

## Step 3 - Download Files

We will now download the ts3audiobot

```shell
cd /opt && git clone https://github.com/Splamy/TS3AudioBot.git
```

### Step 3.1 - Build

To be able to use the TS3Audiobot we have to build it first, for this the following commands are executed.

```shell
cd TS3AudioBot && dotnet build --framework netcoreapp3.1 --configuration Release TS3AudioBot
```

### Step 3.2 - First Startup

To give yourself rights to the bot, you must start the bot for the first time, then you will be asked to specify a TeamSpeak. Specify your TeamSpeak server where this bot should connect. Then when it is connected, you can use the following commands to give yourself rights.

#### Start the bot
```shell
cd /opt/TS3AudioBot/TS3AudioBot/bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1/ && dotnet TS3AudioBot.dll
```

Now connect the bot to some Teamspeak, where you can write to the bot
write the bot with "!getmy uid" for your own teamspeak id | save the uid!

Now we can stop the TS3Audiobot.

#### Setup the rights

IMPORTANT: replace the useruid (REPLACE-WITH-OWN-UID) with your own uid | not the backslashes!

```shell
echo "[[rule]]
        # Set your admin Group Ids here, ex: [ 13, 42 ]
        groupid = []
        # And/Or your admin Client Uids here
        useruid = [ \"REPLACE-WITH-OWN-UID\" ]
        # By default treat requests from localhost as admin
        ip = [ \"127.0.0.1\", \"::1\" ]

        \"+\" = \"*\"" > /opt/TS3AudioBot/TS3AudioBot/bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1/rights.toml
```

### Step 4 - Configure the service

So that the bot is online again after a restart, a service is created which ensures that the bot is started automatically.

#### Create service file
```shell
echo "[Unit]
Description=\"TS3AB-NODE 01\"

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dotnet TS3AudioBot.dll
WorkingDirectory=/opt/TS3AudioBot/TS3AudioBot/bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=TS3AB01

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target" > /etc/systemd/system/ts3ab01.service
```

#### Enable service
```shell
systemctl enable ts3ab01
```

#### Reload the daemon
```shell
systemctl daemon-reload
```

#### Start the TS3AudioBot
```shell
service ts3ab01 start
```

### Step 5 - Configure YouTubeDl (Optional)

#### Installing the dependencies of the yt-dl.
```shell
apt -y install python
```

#### Download the YtDl
```shell
curl -L https://yt-dl.org/downloads/latest/youtube-dl -o /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl
chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl
```

#### Configure the ts3audiobot

Now we have to adjust the configuration of the TS3Audiobot so that it knows that we want to use the YTDL.
For this we have to set the following 2 values

replace in config prefer_resolver with YoutubeDl -> [factories.youtube]
replace in config youtube-dl.path with /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl -> [tools]

```shell
nano /opt/TS3AudioBot/TS3AudioBot/bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1/ts3audiobot.toml
```

## Conclusion

The bot is now fully functional and can play music on each servers.
